                                 Our principals have extensive backgrounds in spearheading buy-side mandates. We fully recognize the strategic importance of a merger or acquisition, and we thus begin each mandate by understanding your corporate history, future goals and overall vision. What sets us apart is that we view our involvement as a partnership that lasts well beyond the closing of the transaction. This is not a commonly held approach in the investment banking community, but it is the cornerstone of our firm.
                                </p>
