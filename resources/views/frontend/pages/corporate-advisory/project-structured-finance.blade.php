                                 MAC Capital offers advisory services in the provision of domestic and international project and structured finance. Project finance is as much a technique as it is a product. It involves structuring the financing for a project based on the credit of the project itself, wholly or partly. This reduces or eliminates recourse to the project's sponsors, a vital consideration.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 Projects with significant capital expenditures, which will produce an identifiable and independent revenue stream, are ideal candidates for project financing. Attributes include those that have contracts for feedstocks (inputs) and off-takes (outputs) at fixed prices or variable prices on both sides that effectively lock in margins. The technique is also highly applicable in the financing of joint ventures with two or more owners who have varying interests and financial strength.
                                </p>
