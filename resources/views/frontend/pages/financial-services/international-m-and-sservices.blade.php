The financial, organizational, managerial and strategic dimensions which they pose create problems the solutions to which can be be very complex. Team MAC has broad experience in assisting clients in various aspects of the merger and acquisition process.

                           Within this domain, we are as much focused on creating M&A and joint venturing opportunities for Indian clients in global markets- what we call “taking India to the world”, as on emerging market acquisitions for global companies.

                           Third party financing often plays a vital role in M&A transactions. Through the firm’s vast network of capital sources, we can arrange financing for a wide range of M&A situations including roll-ups, consolidations, leveraged and management buyouts. We are able to handle all layers of a company’s capitalization to maximize flexibility, pricing and structural optimization.
